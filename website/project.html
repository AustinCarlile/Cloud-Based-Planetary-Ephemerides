    <h1>Project Description</h1>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Our sponsor USGS Astrogeology currently faces many challenges alongside NASA scientists when it comes to generating Image SUpport Data (ISD) for planetary imagery processing. Users of their current system must download large portions of NASA's SPICE dataset to create ISD files, which is time-consuming and a roadblock. Additionally, their current system using Amazon ECS additionally costs the company near $10,000 a month. We will be implementing a RESTful service that integrates USGS's current software (see related links page) so users can access the ISD data online without downloading massive datasets. This new process also ideally will be free for USGS Astrogeology as well as other organizations using the system. Our solution will implement a caching system to reduce ISD generation time by retrieving pre-calculated ISD files then compress large ISD files to reduce the data footprint. This will run on an AWS server taking advantage of the scalability features it offers.</p>
